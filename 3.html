      <a href="https://www.celine.com/en" target="_blank" title="Celine US">Céline</a>, sometimes spelled Celine, is a French female first name of Latin origin, coming from Caelīna, the feminine form of the Roman cognomen Caelīnus, meaning "heavenly". Its equivalent in Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese is Celina. Céline was frequently chosen as a first name in honour of two Gallo-Roman saints closely associated with the beginnings of the French nation:

      Saint Céline of Laon, mother of St Rémy, and Saint Céline of Meaux, a companion of St Geneviève; the feast day for both is 21 October. In addition it is notable for one of the sisters of Saint Thérèse of Lisieux, Céline Martin, who also became a nun.
