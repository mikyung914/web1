  <h2> Brands </h2>
  <p>
    A brand is a <strong>name, term, design, symbol or any other feature</strong> that identifies one seller's good or service as distinct from those of other sellers. Brands are used in business, marketing, and advertising for recognition and, importantly, to create and store value as brand equity for the object identified, to the benefit of the brand's customers, its owners and shareholders. Name brands are sometimes distinguished from generic or store brands.
